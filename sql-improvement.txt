1. Indexes on Frequently Queried Fields
Ensure that the columns used in the JOIN conditions (like job_id, personality_id, job_category_id, etc.) have proper indexes in the database.
This can speed up queries that involve multiple columns.
Besides, sorting by Jobs.sort_order and Jobs.id could be costly on large datasets. 
Make sure that Jobs.sort_order and Jobs.id have indexes too for better performance.

2. Prioritize INNER JOIN
If a particular table always has data (e.g., job_types or job_categories), 
use INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN as LEFT JOIN consumes more execution time compare to INNER JOIN.

3. Use MATCH AGAINST rather than LIKE
The WHERE clause contains many OR conditions with LIKE for the same search term ('%キャビンアテンダント%'). 
This can be executed more efficiently by using MATCH ... AGAINST (Full-text search), if supported by database, which is much faster for large text-based fields.
For example :
WHERE MATCH(Jobs.name, Jobs.description, Jobs.detail, Jobs.business_skill, Jobs.knowledge, Jobs.location, Jobs.activity, Jobs.salary_statistic_group, Jobs.salary_range_remarks, Jobs.restriction, Jobs.remarks) AGAINST ('+キャビンアテンダント' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
